# Machine-Learning
Some small ML projects

Made during the ML course of BITS-Hyd (2023 sem II)

Assignment 1:

Made from scratch using numpy and pandas libraries

Feature Engineering:

1) Replace NAN values with:
   1) mode of column if characteristic data
   2) mean of column if numeric data
3) Normalize the data with (x-mean(x))/std(x)

Perceptron:

Made a perceptron class that finds the weights and has fit() and predict() functions

Note: Not sure if the Perceptron class works perfectly yet.
